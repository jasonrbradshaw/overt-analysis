    "description": "Located on a quiet residential street in Alberta Avenue, the Burns Residence is a two-storey Foursquare with an open front veranda and a brick veneer finish. \"The Burns Residence demonstrates the popularity of this style of building in the early days of Alberta Avenue, and is a somewhat rare example of a two-storey brick residence in this area,\" said David Johnston, Principal Heritage Planner. \"The City of Edmonton is making a concerted effort to sustain Edmonton's built heritage and this designation is part of that ongoing effort.\" The Burns Residence was constructed following an application for a building permit to build a \"shack\" at the site on August 31, 1910. However, the fire insurance map for 1913 indicates a brick house appropriate to the existing footprint at this location. The first occupant at this address in 1911 was John Cheatam, a driver for Norwood Bakery. William Webster, a bricklayer, lived here from 1912 to 1914. Webster may have built the brick house, although no building permit confirms this. James N. Burns, a real estate agent, lived here from 1917 until 1927.",

    "title": "The Hunt Residence (12520 - 109A Avenue NW)",
    "description": "The Hunt Residence, built in 1922, is a one-storey wood frame bungalow. Defining features include a medium pitch gable roof, front facing open porch with two slightly tapered pillars and a five paned eyebrow window in the gable over the porch. The house still has most of the original windows and two exposed brick chimneys. \"The Hunt Residence is a good example of Craftsman design influences, and is representative of the heritage resources remaining in Westmount\" said Johnston. \"The City of Edmonton is making a concerted effort to sustain Edmonton's built heritage and this designation is part of that ongoing effort.\"",

    "title": "The Ernest Morehouse Residence (11153 - 64 Street NW)",
    "description": "This 1912 two-and-a-half storey house is located on a quiet, residential street in the Highlands. Design elements include an open veranda that runs the front width of the house with wooden fascia and pillars with brick bases. The main structure is sheathed in wood siding with corner boards. It has a pyramidal roof with projecting eaves over the veranda, a front bay window shaped by the hip roofed veranda and a balcony centred above the main steps. \"This wood framed Foursquare style house is an early example of the dwellings favoured by moderately well-off Edmontonians prior to the First World War,\" said Robert Geldart, Senior Heritage Planner for the City of Edmonton. Born in Chatsworth, Ontario in 1871, Ernest W. Morehouse trained as an architect in Toronto. He came to Edmonton in 1910 after studying in Chicago, Chatham and Detroit. He, more than any other architect, had a heavy influence on the early development of the Highlands. From 1912-1915, he designed 13 buildings in the Highlands, including the Gibbard Block, the Holgate Residence and the Magrath Residence.",
