		Empiricism is a somewhat nebulous term that can mean different things depending upon who is asked. The word that might first come to mind is empirical. There is empirical evidence, empirical data and empirical laws. The word invokes images of white-coated scientists, beakers and labs, which is fair given the term’s common use in modern times. However, empiricism, specifically of the British kind, is a different entity entirely. The British Empiricists, though certainly not the only individuals exploring these concepts, have been lumped together given their similar ideas, significant contributions and close geographical and temporal proximity.  Hume, Locke and Berkeley were all philosophers of the Enlightenment, writing in and around the 18th century. They are also representative of the 3 nations of the British Isles. Hume was from Scotland, Locke from England and Berkeley from Ireland.  Geography and time period aside, these philosophers also had similar visions on how philosophy should be conducted. As laid out by Margaret Atherton, “Locke, Berkeley, and Hume share a common genetic account of the contents of the understanding: There are no mental contents that cannot be derived from sensation or reflection. This common approach can reasonably be called Empiricism”.  An even more succinct account of this uniting idea of the empiricists is provided by Laurence Carlin in the first line of The Empiricists: A Guide for the Perplexed: “Empiricism is the view that sensory experience is the source of human ideas (or concepts) and/or human knowledge”.  One can now begin to trace the roots of empirical back to empiricism. It takes no stretch of the imagination to see Carlin’s definition of empiricism reflected in empirical science, a science that is based upon the use of observation to derive findings from repeatable experimentation.  
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		These aforementioned similarities have been grounds for grouping Hume, Locke and Berkeley together under the flag of British Empiricism, but this overlooks the distinct contributions made by these philosophers to the field. They should instead be viewed as individuals carrying out their own projects “with motivations that differ significantly one from another”, but with a shared “general view in common that can fairly be called ‘Empiricist’”.  With this in mind, a brief examination of these individuals and their unique approaches to empiricism is in order.  
	</p>

	<!-- John Locke -->

	<a name="locke" class="linkOffset"></a>
	<h2>John Locke</h2>
	<p class="text">	
		John Locke was born in the summer of 1632 in Somerset, England. He began his education at Westminster school before moving up to Christ Church, Oxford University where he was subjected to “a large dose of Scholastic Aristotelianism”.  Locke, like the other empiricists, was opposed to the innatism still widely taught during this time period, but laid out centuries before by Aristotle and Plato.   This opposition found its expression in Locke’s oft-quoted concept of the human mind being a tabula rasa (blank slate) at birth that is then imprinted with experiences from the external world.  For Locke, the experience that fills a blank human mind comes in two varieties: sensation and reflection. Sensations come to the mind by perceiving the qualities of bodies that are external, while reflections happen internally and provide insight into the happenings of the mind itself.  
	</p>
	<p class="text">	
		These two types of experience described by Locke yield ideas, which the philosopher spent a great deal of time on as well. Ideas, for Locke, can be either simple or complex. Simple ideas come into a mind through sensation and reflection, while complex ideas are combinations of several simple ideas. The simple ideas, coming to the mind through experience, are received passively. They are the data that the brain receives from the outside world through the sensory organs. In Locke’s own words, “whatsoever is so constituted in Nature, as to be able, by affecting our Senses, to cause any perception in the Mind, doth thereby produce in the Understanding a simple Idea”.  While simple ideas of sensation may be received passively, one can also reflect internally and produce simple ideas. Processes such as reasoning, judgement and remembrance are simple ideas that are derived by the mind observing “its own Actions about those Ideas it has”.  These simple ideas become the building blocks for complex ideas, which come in 3 different types once the simple ideas are combined: complex ideas of substance are created by combining sensible qualities of objects in the external world in order to perceive distinct objects; complex ideas of relation do not really combine simple ideas, but rather consider them separately and as a means to contrast one thing to another; complex ideas of abstraction are created when one takes several simple ideas and abstracts from them a category, or a “mode”.  The aforementioned sensible qualities found in Locke’s complex ideas of substance also play an important role in his philosophy.
	</p>
	<p class="text">	
		Simple ideas can be related to 2 distinct types of quality, primary qualities and secondary qualities. Locke makes a firm distinction between idea and quality. Qualities are the things that exist in bodies in the external world, while ideas are the imperfect representations of those qualities in the human mind.  Primary qualities are inhered in bodies no matter what changes may occur to it; things like solidity, extension, figure, motion or rest and number.  Secondary qualities, however, may be separable from the bodies that they are attributed to. Things like color, taste and sound produce ideas in the mind that are, to Locke, mere arrangements of primary qualities that may “cause one to attribute a redness to that body, or a pleasant aroma”.  This is a familiar sentiment echoed to this day. Who is to say that one person’s ‘red’ is another’s ‘red’? Color is caused by differing wavelengths of light entering the eye and it is difficult to determine that every human is objectively perceiving the same colors. In a way, Locke can be considered a bit ahead of his time.
	</p>  
	<p class="text">
		It is clear that each of these concepts leads into and depends upon the last. By creating a hierarchy of experience, ideas and qualities, Locke was able to bypass innatism. More than that, he essentially created an epistemological theory that is supported by a scientific approach and “the new philosophy of experimentation”.  Though not the first or only enlightenment thinker to espouse what are now considered empiricist ideals, Locke provided the foundations for this mode of enquiry, and, as will be shown, points of contention for some.

	<!-- George Berkeley -->
	<a name="berk" class="linkOffset"></a>
	<h2>George Berkeley</h2>
	<p class="text">
		George Berkeley was born in March of 1685, close to the county of Kilkenny in Ireland. He received his formal education at Trinity College in Dublin and finished his studies at the tender age of 19. Berkeley became a fellow at the University and shortly after was ordained a priest of the Anglican Church. His best known works (Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision, A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, and Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous) were all published before Berkeley hit 29 years of age.   Any discussion of Berkeley requires first establishing his philosophy’s underlying idealism. Like Locke, Berkeley believed that all human knowledge of the natural world came through the senses. However, Berkeley worried that Locke’s distinction between the realm of ideas and a physical reality extant the body could lead to scepticism directed towards empiricist ideals.  To counter this potential future attack on empiricism, Berkeley did what he believed to be the most sensible thing. He brought everything from the natural world into the sphere of human knowledge by denying the existence of anything external to the human mind and its contents. For Berkeley, “the only things that exist are minds and ideas”.  This was a bold move on Berkeley’s part and one that has received a fair amount of criticism. It seems at odds for an empiricist of the Enlightenment to eschew scientific reasoning for an immaterial idealism, but Berkeley’s philosophical project needs to be considered in light of this underlying attempt to avoid the scepticism that he foresaw. Keeping this in mind, an exploration of this unique empiricist’s work is in order. 
	</p>
	<p class="text">	
		It should be noted that Berkeley still did believe that ordinary objects exist, but that these objects are nothing more than collections of ideas. Where Locke saw ideas as being representative of physical objects inhered in a material substrate, Berkeley distinguished himself by asserting that all objects and their qualities are nothing more than bundles of ideas in the human mind.  Put another way, Locke believed that these objects existed independent of the human mind, while Berkeley viewed everything as being mind-dependent. This idealism is best exemplified by Berkeley’s famous phrase, “esse est pericipi, or to be is to be perceived”.  Ideas are not the only thing to exist in Berkeley’s empiricism, the philosopher also made room for the existence of souls. While ideas may be considered passive objects of knowledge, “there is likewise something which knows or perceives them, and exercises divers operations, as willing, imagining, remembering, about them. This perceiving, active being is what I call mind, spirit, soul, or myself”.  This extension from idea to perceiver is logical and straight forward enough. In a world devoid of materiality, minds (the only thing to exist besides ideas) are a necessary requirement for anything to exist at all. To bolster his case for a reality based upon immaterial idealism, the philosopher put forth 2 arguments in his defence.
	</p>
	<p class="text">	
		The first of these arguments is the argument against Strangely Prevailing Opinion. The opinion Berkeley speaks of is the human inclination to believe that “houses, mountains, rivers, and in a word all sensible objects have an existence natural or real, distinct from their being perceived by the understanding”, which seems strange to the philosopher “for what are the aforementioned objects but the things we perceive by sense, and what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations”.  Carlin summarizes the argument superbly in the form of a syllogism:
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		P: “We perceive sensible objects such as houses, mountains and rivers.”
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		P: “We only perceive sensible ideas, and ideas cannot exist outside of a mind.”
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		C: “Thus, sensible objects such as houses, mountains and rivers just are sensible ideas and cannot exist outside of a mind.” 
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		This is Berkeley’s first attempt at establishing his philosophy of empirical idealism. How can one be sure that any external objects exist when all that resides in the mind are representations or ideas of them? The argument shares some similarities to the concepts expressed by the rationalists, but that is a discussion best left to another research project. 
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		For those in doubt of the logical soundness of his first argument, Berkeley believed that he delivered his coup de grâce to the sceptics with his Master Argument. The philosopher challenges those still in doubt to look “into your own thoughts, and so trying whether you can conceive it possible for a sound, or figure, or motion, or colour to exist without the mind or unperceived. This easy trial may perhaps make you see that what you contend for is a downright contradiction”.  In essence, the Master Argument posits that perception is key to the existence of anything external to the mind. How might something exist if not seen, heard, felt or tasted? Berkeley anticipated a negative reaction to this statement and completes his argument thusly, “there is no difficulty in it ; but what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your mind certain ideas which you call books and trees, and the same time omitting to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them? But do not you yourself perceive or think of them all the while?”  This is where Berkeley believed the strength of his Master Argument to lie. The simple act of trying to conjure up images of mind-independent objects necessitates its perception within the mind. One cannot ever conceive of anything external to it because no perception takes place outside of the mind. Berkeley’s immaterial idealism may stand apart from the empiricism of other Enlightenment thinkers, but it does still adhere to its main tenet: all knowledge is derived through sensory experience.

	<!-- David Hume -->
	<a name="hume" class="linkOffset"></a>
	<h2>David Hume</h2>
	<p class="text">
		The final philosopher of the British Empiricist trifecta is David Hume, born in Edinburgh, Scotland in the year 1711. Hume began his educational career at Edinburgh University and then moved to La Flèche, France where he harassed the local Jesuits from the Jesuit College with his many arguments against religious belief. Unlike the empiricists so far examined, Hume was a staunch religious sceptic and the absence of appeals to god for explanation distinguishes his philosophy from the others.  Another way that Hume deviated from the other empiricists was by re-establishing some of the terminology surrounding human knowledge. He grouped all contents of the mind under the term perception, and held that there were 2 types of things contained within it—ideas and impressions. For Hume, impressions are delivered to the mind through sensory experience. They are the passive information coming in from the outside world. He did think that the process could happen internally as well. Hume calls upon his predecessor Locke by defining inward impressions as being products of reflection, while outward impressions are caused by sensation. While Hume considered impressions to be “lively”, their counterpart, ideas, were considered “less lively” and objects of recollection. Ideas are any functions of the mind that are not impressions, but they are however “‘copies’ of earlier impressions”.  This interplay between impressions and ideas led Hume to a conclusion on how it is that experience can create knowledge—the Copy thesis.
	</p> 
	<p class="text">
		As its name implies, the Copy thesis refers to the origin of ideas from impressions. Ideas are less lively than impressions because they are merely copies of prior impressions. Take pain for instance. One can easily distinguish the difference between experiencing pain (a lively impression) and simply thinking about pain (the less lively idea).  Hume saw this as clearly pointing to the fact that all human knowledge is derived from experience. If ideas are copies of impressions than everything within the human mind can trace its origins back to some sensory event. Another reason Hume believed in the Copy thesis and the role of epistemic experience was due to the activity in the minds of disabled individuals:
	</p>
 	<p class="text">	
 		If it happen, from a defect of the organ, that a man is not susceptible of any species of sensation, we always find that he is as little susceptible of the correspondent ideas. A blind man can form no notion of colours; a deaf man of sounds. Restore either of them that sense in which he is deficient; by opening this new inlet for his sensations, you also open an inlet for the ideas; and he finds no difficulty in conceiving these objects. 
 	</p>
	<p class="text">
		Without the required hardware, these poor souls are unable to receive the impressions that would then inform the subsequent ideas. These foundational components of the Copy thesis gave Hume grounds for an empirical philosophy based upon experience, impressions and sensation. From here, the philosopher was able to flesh out how the human mind is capable of cognizance and complex thought.
	</p> 
	<p class="text">	
		Yet another defining feature of Hume in comparison to the other empiricists was his account of the relation of ideas. Hume believed that “an examination of the contents of our own minds reveals that we naturally relate certain ideas together according to certain principles”.  The empiricist isolated and described 3 such principles, which are resemblance, contiguity (in time or place) and cause and effect. The first of these principles, resemblance, refers to a mind’s proclivity to conjure up ideas from impressions that resemble the impression in some way. For example, when presented with a photograph of some location previously visited, ideas of that trip will readily come to mind. Secondly, the mind makes connections between ideas that are close in time or space due to the principle of contiguity, and so “the idea of salt often leads us to consider pepper”. Finally, the principle of cause and effect leads the mind to connect ideas that are resultant of one another. If one sees an object in motion, ideas come to mind of what set that object into motion. Thoughts and ideas “are often connected on the basis of perceived causal connections”.  Unlike his empirical predecessors, Hume gave an account of the psychological processes occurring inside a human mind with his relation of ideas, which leads into a sceptical claim that the philosopher is well known for.  
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		The idea of causal connections that arise from cause and effect were of great concern to Hume. Particularly, the force, or in the philosophers own terms, necessary connexion, that seemed to entail an effect from a cause.  The concept that Hume was attempting to bring to light here was not the cause or the effect itself, but what happens in between the two. Necessary connection is the power that one supposes to always cause the same effect from the same cause. However, Hume had some issues with this. If no knowledge is known a priori and all knowledge is derived from experience in the form of sensation and reflection, where does the idea of necessary connection come from? It is an invisible process. One can perceive effects following causes, but never that thing, that force, that compels them to. Therefore, according to Hume, there is no real justification to assume that the same cause will always incite the same effect.  That the future will always resemble the past is a flaw in human reasoning, this is Hume’s Problem of Induction. Using induction to predict the future is faulty logic. There is no basis to believe that similar events will always, without fail, unfold. Appealing to past experience as a grounds for such reasoning is faulty as well. Witnessing similar causes producing similar effects in other instances many times before is also inductive. There is no guarantee that cause and effect will operate the same in the future.  There is a strong basis for the belief in cause and effect, given its prevalence in past experience, but it needs to be admitted that there is no justifiable grounds for this inductive form of reasoning.
